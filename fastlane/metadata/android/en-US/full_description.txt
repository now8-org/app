now8 (no wait) is a public transport app that provides improved vehicle arrival time estimations using Machine Learning.

Features:
    • Support for Madrid (Spain).
    • Fuzzy search for stop names and codes. Even if you skip some characters or mistype them the expected result will still appear.

The app collects past arrival times to make better estimations. Aren't you tired of that bus that always comes 5 minutes later than it says? now8 is here to fix that.

This is an open source project, check https://github.com/now8-org for bug reports or code contributions.
